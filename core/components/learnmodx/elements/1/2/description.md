Pagetitle, longtitle and content
================================

Pagetitle is the title of the resource. This is the name you can see in the sidebar and is most commonly used when
displaying the resource on the frontside. Longtitles are often used if you want to have an additional title that is
slightly longer, but not used everywhere. You might for example use the Pagetitle in menus, and the Longtitle as the title
of the page.

Set longtitle
=============

First run the setup, then open up the resource 'Hello' in the sidebar. Change the Longtitle to 'Hello world' and save it.
The save button is located in the top right corner.

When you save you should see that the name of the resource changes in the sidemenu.

Set the content
===============

We are only going to mention the fields description and summary text. These fields are pretty self explanatory and their
uses changes from site to site.

The content field is the field that holds the content of the resource. You might install rich text editors here, that makes
editing easier. We'll get to the in a later chapter. For now, change the content field to say 'Lorem ipsum'.

Verify the section
==================

Verify this when you have made these changes.
