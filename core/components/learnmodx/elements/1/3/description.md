Published, hide from menu and deleted
=====================================

Resources in Modx have three different attributes that might be toggled on and off. These are:

- Published / Unpublished
- Visible in menus / Hidden from menus
- Deleted / Not deleted

Published / Unpublished
-----------------------

This attribute is often used to limit access to certain resources while development/writing is going on. Unpublished
resources can not be access by users that are not logged in, and they will not be displayed in any menus.

As a user you can also schedule when a resource should be published and/or unpublished. These resources can be found
when editing a resource and clicking the tab labeled 'Settings'.

The setting published is toggled when a checkbox when editing a resource under the tab 'Document'. The checkbox is
on the right side above the content area. You can also right click a resource in the sidebar and toggle published/
unpublished there.

Unpublished resources are identified in the sidebar in italic.

Resources are by default unpublished when you create them. This can be changed in the system settings.

Visible in menus / Hidden from menus
------------------------------------

This attribute does what is sounds like. In addition to having access to publishing / unpublishing resource, one might
want to limit visibility to certain pages from menus. This can be achived by toggling this attribute on and off.

Also note that resources that are unpublished also acts as if they are hidden from menus.

Resources that are hidden from menus are grayed out in the sidebar.

Deleted / Not deleted
---------------------

Resources that are deleted act as if they are not published. Resources that have been marked as deleted are identified
in the sidebar in a red color with a strikethough.

You can toggle deleted/not deleted by right clicking resources in the sidebar like you could with published.

When a resource is marked as deleted, you can delete it (or multiple) by clicking the trashcan located at the top
of the sidebar above the resources.

Change attributes
=================

Run the setup, reload the sidebar and change the attributes as indicated by the Pagetitle. Verify when changes are
