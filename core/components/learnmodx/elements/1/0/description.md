The manager
===========

What you are looking at right now is often called the manager. This is the place you go to edit your site.

Don't be afraid
---------------

The manager might be a bit scary at first. Don't worry, we'll introduce you to each section one at a time. For now, you
can ignore most of the Manager, and only focus on the parts we introduce. The rest will be dealt with later.

Dividing up the Manager
-----------------------

First we can create some terms to make it easier to understand what and where you should look.

### The menu

First of all is the menu. This is the top menu that you should se above this text. It should have a green-to-brown gradient.
The search field to the right in the menu is called the Ã¼berbar. The rest of the menu contains submenus to different
settings and sections of the manager.

### The main window

The section you are reading in right now is often referred to as the main window. This part of the screen may change when
you browse the different parts of the manager.

### The sidebar

The narrow section to the left of this part of the screen is often called the sidebar. The sidebar has three tabs at the top,
this should be set to Resources. If you don't have Resources highlighted already, please click that now. The other tabs are the
Elements and the files. We'll get to those later.
