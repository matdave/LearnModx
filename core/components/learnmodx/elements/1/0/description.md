The Manager
===========

What you are looking at right now is often called the Manager. This is the place you go to to edit stuff on your site.
Here you have complete access to all the resources that the site has, any snippets, chunks and templates.

Complexity
----------

The Manager might be a bit scary at first. Don't worry, we were there once too. Modx is so powerful that it requires a lot
of advanced functionality to make it all work like it should, but fear not. You can ignore most of this for now. We'll
introduce you to each aspect of Modx when the time comes.

Dividing up the Manager
-----------------------

First we can create some terms to make it easier to undertand what and where you should look.

### The menu

First of all the menu. This is the top menu that you should se above this text. It should be green going over to a brown-ish
color. Here you have the Ãœberbar that searches in all elements on your site. Further to the right you have access to the
rest of the manager.

### The main window

The section you are reading in right now is often referered to as the main window. This part of the screen may change when
you browse the different parts of the Manager.

### The sidebar

The narrow section to the left of this part of the screen is often called the sidebar. The sidebar has three tabs at the top,
this should be set to Resources. If you don't have Resources highlighted already, plese do so no. The other tabs are the
Elements and the files. We'll get to those later.
